A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### PHP Frontend Generator

* Local Connect web-server
* Live reloading

* RequireJS
* JS testing with Mocha, Qunit, Jasmine or DalekJS

To install generator-frontend-php from npm, run:

Finally, initiate the generator:
