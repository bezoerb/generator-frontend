        "By default, QUnit runs tests when load event is triggered on the window.
        If you're loading tests asynchronously, you can set this property to false,
        then call QUnit.start() once everything is loaded." (source).

        By putting QUnit.config.autostart = false; in a file loaded by requriejs we are basically setting up a race condition.
        It works in Firefox and Safari because they take a little longer to load than Chrome and PhantomJS.
